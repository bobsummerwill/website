I have stepped down as an advisor to [Finhaven](<http://finhaven.com>) (formerly Frontier Foundry).

Why? Is there some terrible problem there, which we need to run away from? No. Just the opposite, in fact. I actually [co-located](<http://bobsummerwill.com/2018/01/05/new-year-new-role-new-office/>) with them in January and am working closer with them than ever before.

Being an advisor meant that I was tying my financial incentives in with Finhaven. I had the option to purchase 0.5% of their Common Stock, but I never exercised that option. I never claimed any expenses, nor received a single penny in any other form. I was "informally" advising them for many months before we had any formal relationship.

_**" It isn't about the money. It was never about the money" ™**_  
_Bob Summerwill 2015-2018_

I am also too busy with [other world-changing projects](<https://bobsummerwill.com/2018/01/31/bob-summerwill-for-headhunters/>) to do much more than talk with FinHaven (lots, every single day). However, the fact is that I am willing to talk to **anybody** in the world for free wherever I see value anyway. I don't need to be an advisor to do that. Those numerous conversations are likely providing a lot more value than many "advisors" just in themselves.

I have a similar dynamic with [RightMesh](<https://www.rightmesh.io>), [Zipper](<https://zipperglobal.com/>) and [Status.im](<https://status.im/>), which are all projects and teams which I love to death, and would jump with joy to advise. But the truth is that I can provide **even greater value** **from the outside**. That has been the case for me on the [Ethereum Project](<https://ethereum.org/>) too, where I have been able to do much more to help the project from the outside of the [Ethereum Foundation](<https://ethereum.org/foundation>) than when I was working **for** the EF.

**Being a friend is the best relationship of all. It trumps employment, contracting, consulting, advising.**

Here are some examples of being a friend trumping any formal relationship just in the last few days:

I will forever be a friend of [FinHaven](<https://finhaven.com>) and do everything I can to help them.

I love you guys!
