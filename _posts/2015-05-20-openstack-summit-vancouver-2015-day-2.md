The first session in the keynote for day two consisted of Mark Collier talking to a lot of people about a lot of different projects.

  * There are 10s of thousands of servers at Yahoo! on OpenStack, moving up to 100s of thousands.
  * Pantheon is running 100,000 Drupal and WordPress sites.
  * Magnum is a new containers-as-a-service element within OpenStack. Can drive Kubernetes or Docker "bays".
  * Introduction of the [Community App Catalog](http://apps.openstack.org), which is a repository containing package definitions. Lots of there already. Grab what are essentially blueprints/templates, including all dependencies. I need to understand how these are similar or different to Cloudify blueprints.
  * Google demoed the Kubernetes setup running on both Google and OpenStack clouds, with near identical configuration settings.
