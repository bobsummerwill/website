So today, Friday 9th October 2015, is my last day at TD Securities.

[Farewell and best wishes, TD Securities](https://vimeo.com/141925932) from [Bob Summerwill](https://vimeo.com/user40134673) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

It's been a lot of fun, and I just want to wish everyone all the best. Keep believing! If you believe in yourself, things might work out well. If you give up on yourself, you are doomed to failure, so keep smiling 🙂

My lovely team took me for lunch on Tuesday and presented me with a "Bob". I'll really miss you guys 🙂
