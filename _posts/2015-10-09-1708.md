My discovery of the day, while at a **TD Canada Trust** branch getting a business account set up by **Emily Chen** (thank you), **is that there is a TD mascot!** I never knew. RBC have got the guy in the bowler hat. CIBC have got the penguin. TD? Nada. I thought. We need a mascot, but don't have one.

I was wrong. We have "TD". Here he is …

… just one problem. He's really lame! No wonder I'd not spotted him. I imagine he "doesn't get out much".

As The Financial Brand said at the time of the mascot's introduction in 2010 … [TD Introduces Mascot, But What the Heck Is It?](<http://thefinancialbrand.com/12214/td-bank-mascot/>) 🙂
