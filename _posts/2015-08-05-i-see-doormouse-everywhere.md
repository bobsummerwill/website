[![Dormouse](/assets/images/dormouse.png)](</assets/images/dormouse.png>)

Parents with children of a certain age will be painfully familiar with [Doormouse](<http://teamumizoomi.wikia.com/wiki/DoorMouse>), a recurring character in Nickelodeon's [Team Umizoomi](<http://teamumizoomi.wikia.com/>) series. He seems to work everywhere, and always in the same role, as an annoying character who obstructs our heroes from reaching their goal.

He is a classic [gatekeeper](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper>). It is not a likeable role.

Now I see Doormouse everywhere I look in my digital life. Unlike the real world, where resources are limited and some degree of gatekeeping is required, most digital scarcity is artificial and oligarchical. There is a battle brewing, and that battle is between the **hierarchy and the network**. [Paul Mason has articulated this pretty well, I think](<http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun>).

Generally speaking, Doormouse and his fellow artificial gatekeepers add little value in digital systems. They just maintain the status quo, and obstruct innovation and progress. I would love to see them all [crash into Mars](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2401445/>)!
