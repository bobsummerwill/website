I belatedly bought a Samsung Z1 smartphone from a reseller in India via eBay, and have made a video showing the phone.

Here are the [hardware specs for the Samsung Z1](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_z1-6894.php). It's certainly not anywhere near the [Samsung Z flagship which was promised last year](http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_z-6403.php), but it's not bad for what it is. The box is very "busy" and ugly in comparison to the Galaxy series packaging. The phone itself is fine. Reminds me of the original Galaxy S, or an iPhone 3GS.

Hope you all enjoy the video! Best wishes …
