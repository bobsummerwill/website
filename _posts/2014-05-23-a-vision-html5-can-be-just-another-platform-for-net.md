See [http://html5dot.com](<http://html5dotnet.com> "http://html5dotnet.com") for my latest idea.

HTML5.NET could be a real target platform. Multi-selectable for PCLs. You would use the MVVM pattern to share code across multiple native platforms (iOS, Android, WinStore, etc) and HTML5. Just like Xamarin native, but for the web as well.
