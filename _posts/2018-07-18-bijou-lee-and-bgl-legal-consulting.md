**" My lawyer is awesome" - **I bet that isn't something which too many people can say!

I have been self-employed for the last four years, working either as a consultant or contractor to DeNA, SCEA San Diego, TD Securities, Prizorgo, Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys and Sweetbridge. That after 18 years as a full-time employee to Sony Psygnosis and EA.

By late 2015 I was feeling the pain of the lack of basic technical competence amongst lawyers and accountants as I was running my small business. I needed more, so I asked the Ethereum community for help on Reddit as the New Year approached:

[Have you met blockchain savvy accountants and lawyers in Canada?](<https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3y434a/have_you_met_blockchain_savvy_accountants_and/?st=jagzeyo5&sh=3dcbb1cf>)

Do have a read of the responses to that thread. This was my favorite:

So I didn't actually make any change at that point, due to mixture of lack of options and also getting busy with other things, but as the 2018 financial year approached I left it was time to revisit this question, so I asked Reddit again and this time I got a great answer:

[Deja Vu - Have you met blockchain savvy accountants and lawyers in Canada? 2017 edition](<https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7hq4f2/deja_vu_have_you_met_blockchain_savvy_accountants/?st=jjrdebs6&sh=b929a050>)

The way in which Bijou was introduced to me immediately gave me a great feeling. Her contact options included PGP encrypted email and Signal. Excellent - some opsec - this is going to be good! I was not wrong.

So I retained Bijou in January of this year and have been working with her since as I have worked through working out what I want to do with myself. The first thing which I asked her to do was to look at options for single-individual non-profit organizations in Canada, both federally and provincially. The **Summerwill Foundation** or whatever. That is not something which I will be pursuing right now, but I wanted to look into that option.

So she did some legal research for me on that, which I am happy to share with the world, subject to this disclaimer:

More recently, Bijou has been helping me with legal work around **[Varro Technologies](<https://varro.tech>)** , the new company which I have co-founded with **[Alison Alexis](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/alison-alexis-ca/>)** , who has a background as an accountant - hurrah!

So, if you are looking for a digital native who can actually help you as a partner with your blockchain needs, I would recommend that you get in touch with Bijou. Finally I have a legal professional who I consider as a partner, not as a liability.

She tells me that she is dealing with clients in Canada, the USA and Hong Kong so far.
