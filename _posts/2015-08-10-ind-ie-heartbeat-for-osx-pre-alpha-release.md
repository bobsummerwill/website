Today is a long awaited day for me and many others - the first [public release](https://forum.ind.ie/t/heartbeat-pre-alpha-update/164) of [Ind.ie](https://www.ind.ie/)'s [Heartbeat](https://www.ind.ie/about/vision/) client for OSX. What is that? It is a social network client which does not spy on you. It is the first step in a journey to **" create a peer-to-peer consumer platform to empower you to share the things that matter to you with the people you care about"**

Today is the day that the mud-slingers, vaporware-accusers and general negative whingers can STFU and see what these [talented](https://www.ind.ie/about/team/) and [principled](https://aralbalkan.com/notes/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/) individuals have been working on all this time:

Here is a video of the OS X client in action:

**" What? OS X Yosemite only? You sell-outs!"** A common whinge. The rationale for this pragmatic trade-off is explained in [We're Building for OS X and iOS, not Linux. This is not a bug, it's a feature. Here's why …](https://forum.ind.ie/t/we-re-building-for-os-x-and-ios-not-linux-this-is-not-a-bug-it-s-a-feature-here-s-why/542)

The [Indie Manifesto](https://www.ind.ie/about/manifesto/) is not just rhetoric. These guys are building real software to fight the [Camera Panopticon](https://ind.ie/the-camera-panopticon/) trend. And it looks lovely. Surprise, surprise. Apparently, having designers are the core of a project results in good UX!

The code is publicly available at [source.ind.ie](https://source.ind.ie), which is a [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) instance. Here's a video showing how to clone the [heartbeat-cocoa](https://source.ind.ie/project/heartbeat-cocoa) repository. Nothing very surprising there for [Github](http://github.com) regulars.

Bravo, [Oscar](https://ind.ie/labs/) and team! A banner day for [indies](https://ind.ie/about/manifesto/). Hot on the heels of the [Ethereum Frontier](https://ethereum.org/) release too! It is great to see multiple projects pushing towards a freedom-respecting and decentralized future.
