It is D-Day! Today is my last day at EA! I blogged about my [career move](https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/end-of-an-era/) on the day I resigned.

I started working for EA in the UK Studio on 4th January 1999. My best wishes go out to my colleagues and ex-colleagues for whatever the future may have in store for them, and for EA!

If you're in Vancouver, do come to the [Soho for drinks on Friday night from 7pm](https://www.facebook.com/events/576338185819463). If you are elsewhere, please do raise a glass tomorrow night to celebrate some amazing years of fun and success at EA!
