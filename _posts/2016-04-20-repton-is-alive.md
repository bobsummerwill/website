I have just been followed on Twitter by [Superior Interactive](http://www.superiorinteractive.com/). Oh my, my!

Who are Superior Interactive? They are the company formerly known as [Superior Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_Software), who filled my [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) youth with the joy of such classics as [Repton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repton_\(video_game\)) (with a level editor in later versions), [Thrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_\(video_game\)), [Bonecrusher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonecruncher) and more!

Wikipedia tells me that Superior was set up by Richard Hanson and John Dyson, who I now discover were graduates of the University of Leeds, just like me.

It is a delight to make your reacquaintance, Superior, even if, as in all likelihood, it was in a completely algorithmic and impersonal manner 🙂

And who can forget **" It's Time To Play Bonecruncher!"**
