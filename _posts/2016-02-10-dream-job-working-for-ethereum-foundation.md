I am delighted to share the news that I will be starting my dream job on Monday, as a part-time contractor for the [Ethereum Foundation](http://ethereum.org) working on the [Ethereum C++ client](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/).

As anybody who knows me will be aware, I've been **rather obsessed with Ethereum** over the past few months, and have been putting a lot of time and effort into the C++ client via [doublethink.co](http://doublethink.co), first with [Anthony Cros](https://twitter.com/anthony_cros) and then more recently on my own. It has been a real blast.

Now I get the opportunity to continue that work from the inside. This is a real honor for me. The Ethereum community is a delight, and I am ecstatic to have the opportunity to work directly as part of the Ethereum development team.

I truly believe that Ethereum has the potential to impact our technical and social landscape to as significant degree as the Internet did in the 90s, and the opportunity to work with the inner group building that future is a once-in-a-lifetime golden ticket of geeky joy for me.

Woot, woot - Happy Hat!
