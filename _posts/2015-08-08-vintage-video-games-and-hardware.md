This afternoon I visited [Buy and Sell Kings](http://www.buyandsellkings.net/), on Danforth Ave in Toronto. It is amazing.

They have pretty much every historic video game console you could name for sale, and rafts of games for them all. Some particular gems were [Atari VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600), [Neo-Geo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Geo_\(system\)), [Sega Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Game_Gear), [Colecovision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision) and even a [Panasonic 3DO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer). It was quite a treat.

Here is a walk-through:
