Today I have pulled the trigger on a purchase which I have been pondering since I [visited Buy and Sell Kings](https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/vintage-video-games-and-hardware/) a few weeks back.

Here what is coming my way soon, _supposedly_ tested. I certainly hope it all works. I will report back 🙂
