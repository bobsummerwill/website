**UPDATE - We have a room assigned! H.3244 on Sunday 2nd February between 14.30 and 15.30. That is upstairs in the H building which has the info centre, T-shirts and some of the rooms for the talks. Look for the BoF signs pointing in the right way.**

Greetings!

I am proposing a blockchain "Birds of a Feather" session at FOSDEM 2020.

**Who is with me?**

There was a similar session at FOSDEM 2018, and while I missed FOSDEM 2019, I understand that one was held there too.

FOSDEM is a unique "neutral ground" from the horrors of blockchain tribalism. I have spent a lot of time [in the last two years](<https://bobsummerwill.com/2018/03/01/a-call-for-an-end-to-tribalism-in-ethereum/>) working to build bridges between different factions of the blockchain ecosystem, particularly within Ethereum, but also across the whole space.

We all have so more more in common than we have differences, especially when it comes to the "foot soldiers" who are actually working on blockchain technology rather than the products or "coins" which incorporate that technology.

Please join [this Telegram group](<https://t.me/joinchat/BWcyChFzpeqjeIKlzsM8jg>) for updates.

When we have a room/time I will update this blog post and tweet that out too.

Best wishes,  
Bob Summerwill
