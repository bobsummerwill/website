  * Real enjoyment of mentoring and leadership of more junior engineers
  * Unparalleled goodwill and broad connections across the blockchain ecosystem, both public and enterprise.
  * Community and ecosystem focus, which means that I can be very useful in building positive PR for the company and defusing trolls and haters.
