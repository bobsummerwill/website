I have just landed in beautiful Cancun, Mexico, for the [DEVCON3 conference](http://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/) which starts on Wednesday.

DEVCON is the crowd jewel of the Ethereum community, where developers, business people and enthusiasts of all stripes gather in one place to hear the latest news about this fantastic platform which we are building together. Right from the mouths of the developers who are at doing that every day.

Unlike many other blockchain events, DEVCON is always about the technology and the people - never about money. It is a **developer conference** , with many deeply technical sessions. It is a delight.

These are my people. I will be with my tribe this week. I can't wait.
