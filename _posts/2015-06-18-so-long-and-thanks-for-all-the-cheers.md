I have been signing off every e-mail in this way for about twenty years:

> **Cheers,**  
>  **Bob**

Apparently I am [doing it wrong](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/the-best-e-mail-signature-is-actually-the-worst).

So what will my new signature be, and the best way to sign off on e-mails? With nothing. It will be hard, but it starts here.
