I reached out to [Nicole Faerber, the CTO of Purism](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicole-faerber-71ba3195/), a week or so back to ask whether there was a Birds of a Feather session organized at FOSDEM 2020 around the [Purism Librem 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Librem_5) device, and she said no, so I volunteered to organize one.

As per the [Purism website](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/),_" The Librem 5 represents the opportunity for you to take back control and protect your private information, your digital life through free and open source software, open governance, and transparency. The Librem 5 is a phone built on [PureOS](https://pureos.net/), a fully free, ethical and open-source operating system that is not based on Android or iOS (learn more about [why this is important](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/pureos-mobile/))."_

Devices are being shipped to developers and the multi-year process from conception to first release is coming to a climax.

There will be various Purism people at FOSDEM, who can give us an update on the State of The Union, demonstrate actual devices and take part in some Q&A.

We won't have an assigned room until I get to the campus and can book one. When that happens I will update this blog post accordingly.

Best wishes!
