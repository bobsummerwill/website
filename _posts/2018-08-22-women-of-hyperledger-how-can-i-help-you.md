So today is the last day of Hyperledger TSC voting. The polls close at 5pm Pacific today, with the results announced tomorrow.

There was a little Twitter activity around my observation on the [diversity issues which we have in the TSC,](<http://bobsummerwill.com/2018/08/15/hyperledger-tsc-candidates-and-thoughts-on-diversity/>) and a new mail thread has been kicked off:

[How can we improve diversity in the Hyperledger technical community?](<https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/message/1593>)

I am a Community Ambassador for CryptoChicks and I care deeply about this topic and will do everything which I can to help promote a healthy and welcoming environment for women in the Hyperledger technical community.

**Women of Hyperledger - How can I help you? Please join that thread.**
