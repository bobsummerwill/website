The inaugural [DevOps For Banks Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DevOpsTO/events/225116642/) here in Toronto which I [previewed a while back](https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/devops-for-banks-meetup-toronto/) happened last Tuesday. It was a lot of fun. I provided the social glue to bring the event into existence but the evening itself was the work of many hands. Thank you all 🙂

We'll have to do it again, eh?

Join us this month for a special DevOps for Banks session hosted by ThinkData Works!

Format: some short presentations and discussions followed by free-form mingling on the rooftop patio.

**Presentations/discussions:**

**Why are we here?** - **Bob Summerwill (DevOps Solutions Architect, TD Securities)**

Bob will spend a few minutes providing an introduction to this special session.

**Incident Management - Dave Cliffe (PagerDuty)  
**

As DevOps is proving, breaking down silos between Dev and Ops is critical to any IT organization, no matter what industry you're in. A huge part of that is the idea of "shared operational responsibility", where everyone is responsible for production, not just Operations staff. Let's have a discussion about the impact on monitoring, alerting, on-call processes, and broader Incident Management in this brave new world of DevOps.

**Chef Analytics - Andrew Dufour (Chef)  
**

Most people in the DevOps field know Chef as a configuration management product. We'll explore how Chef Analytics and Audit mode can help you drive innovation at velocity in a highly regulated, compliance based environment.
