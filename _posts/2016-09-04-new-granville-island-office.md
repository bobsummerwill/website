I had been working from a coffee shop every day for the best part of the year. That was just fine in most respects, but it has meant that I never completed the setup of my hardware test farm for [cpp-ethereum-cross](https://github.com/doublethinkco/cpp-ethereum-cross). It was time for me to look at rented desk space again.

I found a real beauty of a spot which was newly available on Granville Island, right by the water, in a converted houseboat, by [The Profile](http://granvilleisland.theprofile.ca). I am already finding lots of common interests with my coworkers. There is an old TV, and my Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 are definitely going to get hooked up 🙂
