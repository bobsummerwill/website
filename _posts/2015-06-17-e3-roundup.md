The E3 trade show has been going on this week, with major press conferences from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft. As always, some new projects have been revealed, along with progress demonstrated on projects previously announced. There were also some announcements in the run-up to E3 which I will include here too for context.
