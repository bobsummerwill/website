This is Employee Appreciation Week at TD Bank, an annual event to recognize the contributions which everyone has made to the success of the company in the course of the year, and to have some fun. I was greeted at the elevator door on Monday morning with a fantastic table of chocolate medals and some smiling faces.

**Armen Vanayan** "crowned" me with my medal and **Desmond Lo** was kind enough to take the picture of us both.

This was also where we could pick up our BBQ tickets for later in the week. I ended up passing my "medal" on to my 3 year old son, who just loved it.

Always nice to have a bit of fun at work!
