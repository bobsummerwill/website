## Brain dump which will become a series of articles on the history of mobile Linux, plus a "State of the Union". Possible split of content into 3 articles?

  * Part 1 - The Golden Age - 2005 to 2011
  * Part 2 - Misery and despair - 2012 to 2015
  * Part 3 - Renaissance? - 2015+



## Introduction

The battlefield of mobile Linux has essentially been in a state of misery and despair mingled with phony war since 2012, but the tide is starting to turn. TODO - Need a single characterization, not two.

How did we get here? Where are we going? Will a true mobile Linux rise up to form a third eco-system to compete with Android and iOS?

See [Mer and mobile operating systems (SVG)](/website/assets/images/external/misc/Mer_and_mobile_operating_systems.svg) and [MeeGo and co timeline](/website/assets/images/external/misc/MeeGo_and_co_timeline.svg) (SVG).

_[Caveat - the author's own personal involvement in mobile Linux development began in 2014, so this history is all second-hand. Feedback, corrections, observations on alternative perspectives, etc. are all exceedingly welcome]_

## Prelude

In the beginning was [Embedded Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_embedded_systems). The Linux Kernel is a good fit for small form-factor devices without realtime needs because of its small footprint, the fact that it can be customized easily, and the fact that it is free of licensing fees and other up-front costs. There is a clear lineage from embedded through mobile to wearable and Internet of Things. These devices are all just small form-factor computers, with a variety of input and output devices and connectivity options.

What is the difference between an embedded device and an IoT device? Not a lot, other than IoT implies connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi, other), where embedded devices would usually be standalone.

What is the difference between an embedded device and a mobile device? Again, usually the answer is just connectivity, with the connectivity in that case being a 2G/3G/LTE modem. Dumbphones and smartphones aren't so different either, other than that smartphones often split the modem functionality off onto its own baseband processor, and support app stores. The OS on the application processor is usually updatable too.

What is the difference between a wearable device and an IoT device? Nothing much in the case of "smart" wearables, other than the form factor. Both categories are usually just small form factor computers with connectivity.

The overarching trend is actually a convergence of different technology categories, where all devices are becoming more powerful, connected and over-the-air updatable. The smartphone was a particularly successful early example of that convergence trend, as it replaced many of the functions which were [previously served by multiple devices](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/04/cameras-keycards-everyday-devices-killed-off-by-the-smartphone-gadgets).

See [Linux for mobile devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_mobile_devices) on Wikipedia.

## Meltimi

  * [Anonymous ExNokian](https://twitter.com/ExNokian) says - First of all: This lacks Meltemi. That is not to be surprised, best and only description of the project I know comes from book "Operaatio Elop", which is not available in English. There people who were involved with the project said the phones would have been rady to shopes on 1H2013 at earliest and that the project had severely overgrown to a replay of MeeGo, i.e. large, complex and ineffective.

## Mer, Sailfish and Jolla

  * Mer was the only true successor, because Tizen was really just a continuation of the earlier SLP project.
  * Find those archive.org postings announcing the reboot of the Mer project.
  * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolla_(mobile_phone)>
  * Jolla Phone was originally going to be built on [ST-Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST-Ericsson) chipset and would have been a Qt4 device, with Qt5 coming later, before that vendor went bankrupt and they were forced to pivot. New vendor was Qualcomm, with a simultaneous technology jump from Qt4 to Qt5, X11 to Wayland, all within a 6 month period and unaltered ship date. Amazing.
  * Jolla unveiled details of their Jolla Phone on 20th May 2013, and it was shipped on 27th November 2013. Since then it has been launched in various further markets. Jolla also started a crowdfunded tablet project. That is still in progress.
  * Say something about Sailfish Alliance, and about Mer and Nemo and Sailfish versus Jolla, and about proprietary OS.
  * [Sailfish Porting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS#Porting)
  * Q - Does Sailfish OS include the Silica proprietary bits? Android support is Jolla Phone specific. Jolla branding will be Jolla-specific, so where does the line fall on "What is Sailfish OS?"
  * Company split announced.
  * Sailfish 2.0 release.
  * Delays on Jolla Tablet.



## The Mobile Linux Phony War (2012 to 2015)

Firefox OS and Ubuntu Touch are unrelated to MeeGo and LiMo, and were migrations of desktop Linux technology onto mobile.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Touch>

Ubuntu Touch was announced by Canonical on 2nd January 2013, and the first device, the Bq Aquaris E4.5 went on sale in Europe on 9th February 2015. The second device is the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu, which went on sale on 25th June 2015, but it is Invite-only.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS>

Firefox OS was first publicly demonstrated in February 2012 and the first public handset was the ZTE Open, released by Telfonica in Spain in 2nd July 2013. There are now a lot of devices, see
