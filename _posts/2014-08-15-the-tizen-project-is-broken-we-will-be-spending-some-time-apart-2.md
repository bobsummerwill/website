I'm very sad to have to say this, but the [Tizen Project](http://tizen.org) is broken, and we're going to be spending some time apart. It makes no sense for [Kitsilano Software](http://kitsilanosoftware.com) to spend any more time or money on building [MonoTizen](http://monotizen.com) at the current time.

See [Kitsilano Software blog posting](http://kitsilanosoftware.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/the-tizen-project-is-broken-we-will-be-spending-some-time-apart-3/) for more details.
