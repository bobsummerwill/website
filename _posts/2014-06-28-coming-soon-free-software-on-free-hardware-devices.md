In the near future we will have [free software](<http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software>) running on [free hardware](<http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw>) devices.

I have personally registered and will maintain various domain names in preparation for that time, and will transfer their registrations to appropriate future project owners at the direction of the [Free Software Foundation](<http://www.fsf.org>).

See [GPL Central](<http://gplcentral.org>) for more details.
