UPDATE - 16th August 2015 - Great new **New York Times** article:

[Ideas in a Bruising Workplace](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)

The company is conducting an experiment in how far it can push  
white-collar workers to get them to achieve its ever-expanding ambitions.

And reaction in Forbes:

[gawker.com](http://gawker.com) has [published a series of whistle-blower articles](http://gawker.com/tag/amazon) exposing the darkness at the heart of [Amazon](http://amazon.com). These are hugely important articles, but seem to have received very little media "oxygen". The revelations are important information for all [Amazon](http://amazon.com) customers.

These articles, in combination with my own first-hand interactions with the company have convinced me that [Amazon](http://amazon.com)'s corporate culture is sociopathic, with no concern for the negative impacts on the lives of their employees and on society as a whole. I interviewed at Amazon Vancouver, which is what made me realize the horrors within. I didn't know before that. Individuals who have any moral backbone must acknowledge that [Amazon](http://amazon.com) **should be shunned and boycotted** in response to what we now know about them.

I will never work for Amazon. I will never again give my tacit approval of their behavior by being their customer, no matter how convenient their services may be. There are alternative service providers. I have returned my Kindle Fire HD tablet. I am seeking to convert my previous Kindle eBook purchases into open formats.

Some things are much more important than money. [Amazon](http://amazon.com) have crossed a line in the sand for me, and I will not be silent and complicit in the face of such appalling business practices.
