So I'm delighted to report that as of April 2016, I will be contracting for the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/foundation) **full time!**

I started work for the Foundation part-time just over [a month ago](http://bobsummerwill.com/2016/02/10/dream-job-working-for-ethereum-foundation/), and it's been the most enjoyable work which I have done for many, many years. I've been working on [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) for fun since last year at [doublethink.co](http://doublethink.co), and now I can focus entirely on it.

My [BlockGrantX-funded](http://doublethink.co/2016/02/23/we-have-blockgrantx-funding/) work on **" Ethereum for resource-constrained devices"** will keep ticking along on the side. We made Homestead releases [last week](http://doublethink.co/2016/03/07/released-cross-build-eth-binaries-for-homestead/) and I posted an [update on our status](http://doublethink.co/2016/03/14/doublethinkco-ethereum-homestead/).

The run up to the [Homestead Release](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/29/homestead-release/) was a huge rush. I spent much of my time that week (and weekend) working on the [Ethereum Documentation](http://ethdocs.org). If you have not seen that, please do check it out, including the new home of the [cpp-ethereum docs](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum).

Thanks to everybody at the Foundation and in the Ethereum community who make this project a delight to work on. Have a great weekend, everyone!
