[Faith Obafemi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faithobafemi/) is from Nigeria and is very, very multi-talented **( "Digital Lawyer || Digital Content Consultant || Blockchain and Crypto Researcher || Freelance Writer")**.

I was first introduced to her earlier this year by [Ash Nazir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashnazir/) who runs the [IoTGadgets](http://iotgadgets.com) website which I wrote some articles for in its prior life as Tizen Experts, in my own prior life as a mobile and wearable developer, between my videogames and my Ethereum periods, and where Faith now writes.

Faith's output there has swamped my efforts 🙂

When she started writing about blockchain, Ash connected us, and we started talking about Sweetbridge too - seeing whether we could get a first community manager kind of role happening there in Africa. That hasn't happened yet, but there is still plenty of time!

Faith has been accepted as a speaker on **" Crypto Regulations that Protect Investors"** at the [CryptoChicks hackathon and conference](http://cryptochickshackathon.com/) in Toronto, April 6-8, 2018, but there are no expenses provided for travel and accommodation. I think that Faith is a hugely important person to have to the conference given her unique skills, and also as a pioneering African woman in law, technology and blockchain.

_(Bob with[Elena Sinelnikova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esinelnikova/) and [Natalia Ameline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalia-ameline-3475703/) of CryptoChicks in Toronto March 2018)_

[CryptoChicks](http://cryptochicks.ca/) is a blockchain community made by women for women. This is their first conference and hackathon:

_We are a non-profit blockchain educational hub with a mission to achieve gender balance in the blockchain space._

_Our classes are open to everyone, but we are particularly focused on educating women because we believe that women’s involvement will help blockchain realize its enormous potential as an instrument of positive change in the world._

_We hold workshops for female investors, female entrepreneurs, women involved in technology, female corporate managers, career ladies, housewives, grandmothers, and all other women. If you are curious but feel that this blockchain and cryptocurrency stuff seems scary to you, try to make it to our “Intro To Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies” class or watch this[video](http://cryptochicks.ca/#Intro). We make learning fun. You will not be disappointed!_

Faith estimates that it will cost her about $2,000 USD to attend.

Please do donate, if you would like to help support her. If not enough funds are raised, she will send all the funds to CryptoChicks. If any excess funds are raised, they will go to CryptoChicks too.
