## What is this blog post about?

I am on the job market at the moment and thought it would be worthwhile to summarize what I have to offer and what I am looking for, to avoid numerous near-identical phone calls and "getting to know you" chats.

This blog post is intended to act as an initial filter to save everyone's time.

## What does Bob have to offer?

  * Nearly two decades of varied professional software engineering and problem-solving experience.
  * Work on application teams, in central technology roles, technical leadership, on shared initiatives, and more.
  * Huge breadth of technical knowledge. Always learning.
  * Deep knowledge of configuration management, automation, DevOps and software engineering best practices.
  * Still a hands-on coder who wants to be "doing the work", not just overseeing.
  * Optimistic, enthusiastic, friendly, social, chatty demeanour.
  * A completely open book. Not afraid to ask hard questions and to point out "elephants in the room".
  * Blogging and social media presence. Loves to write.



## What does Bob need and want?

  * "Mission" is of real importance to me. I need to feel that my work is important and is making the world a better place.
  * Remote-friendly roles would be a good fit for me. Relocation from Vancouver is not of interest.
  * Ability to work on own projects is essential, hence preference for contracting over employment.
  * Probably best suited to technical leadership positions, but individual contributor is OK too.
  * Anything Linux-related would be very appealing.
  * Development work on open source projects as part of a role would be a big draw.
  * Working for a company with open source products (Red Hat, Canonical, Mozilla, etc) would be fantastic.
  * Anything related to block-chain (especially Ethereum) and decentralization would be amazing.
  * Not particularly interested in games companies at the moment. Enjoying branching out.
