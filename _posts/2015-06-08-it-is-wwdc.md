So today is the day which Apple fans around the world have been waiting for. It is the first day of Apple's yearly Worldwide Developer Conference, held in San Francisco around this team every year, where Apple's latest products and innovations are revealed to the public.

Here is a [What to expect from Apple at WWDC 2015](http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/05/apple-wwdc-2015-preview/) article. You will find many more around the Internet.

And here is a [live blog stream](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8731577/wwdc-2015-schedule-watch-online-time-apple-event). Again, this is one of many.

Or you can watch the live video stream straight [from Apple](http://www.apple.com/live/). Annoyingly they only support that stream on Apple devices, either through an Apple TV, or through Safari on a Mac or iOS device. Of course.
