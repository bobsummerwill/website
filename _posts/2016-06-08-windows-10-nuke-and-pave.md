So today was the day where I had enough of screwing around with trying to get Visual Studio 2015 installed on my Surface Pro 3.

I had been battling [Team Explorer for Visual Studio 2015 -> Fatal Error](<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33855177/multiple-errors-installing-visual-studio-2015-community-edition>) for a week or so, like many suckers before me, and was fed up of trying hack-after-hack.

**It was time to nuke-and-pave!**

And I am very glad that I did. I now have my Surface Pro 3 with the following fully-comprehensive setup for [cpp-ethereum](<http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum>) development:

  * Windows 10 Pro Insider Edition Build 14361.0 (with Bash-for-Windows)
  * Visual Studio Community 2013 Update 5
  * Visual Studio Community 2015 Update 2
  * Visual Studio Enterprise 15 Preview 2



All at the same time below!

And just for bonus points, my question of [Best means for getting photos OFF Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition?](<https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg20511.html>) now has a great answer. That device (my main phone for the last few months) has a really flaky USB, which has been failing to show up on my MacBook Air OS X El Capitan almost 100% of the time.

It works a treat on Windows 10 though, I find, which means that I have no excuse for not starting to do some blog posts on OSCON, with photos.

Two great features in this latest Insider Preview too, both of which I plan to take advantage of. So, good progress in pressing the reset button 🙂

**LastPass extension for Microsoft Edge:** We are excited to announce that LastPass, a popular free password management extension, is now available for download. Visit our [extensions page](<https://aka.ms/msedge-extensions>) at the Microsoft Edge Dev website to learn more and try it out for yourself! Be sure to check out the list of known issues for the LastPass extension [here](<https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/changelog/desktop/14361/>).

**Introducing Hyper-V Container:** You can now use [Docker](<http://www.docker.com/what-docker>) natively on Windows 10 with Hyper-V Containers, to build, ship and run containers utilizing the [Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn765472.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396>) Nano Server container OS image. A new version of the Docker engine for Windows has also been made available that extends the support of containers while also improving the DockerFile syntax and getting started experience for users. For more details on how to get started with this [check out the Windows container documentation](<http://aka.ms/containers>) or the [Windows 10 Getting Started Guide](<https://aka.ms/windowscontainers/hypervonwin10>).
