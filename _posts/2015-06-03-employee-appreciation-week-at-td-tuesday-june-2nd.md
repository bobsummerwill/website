Tuesday was a beautiful day in Toronto, and Day #2 of the Employee Appreciation Week, and the first of two BBQ events was scheduled for lunchtime at the TD Centre. **Dave Manley** and I went down for some nosh, and there was a reasonable lineup for the tasty fare on offer. In fact, there was a BURGER CRISIS, which was narrowly adverted. People were having to walk on down the line and then come back later to add their burgers to their buns. **Ty Panagoplos, the TD Securities CIO** was on burger duty and get the burgers in buns to clear the backlog! Tasty burgers and corn for me, while Dave went for a hot dog.

We bumped into **Alice Lee** who was making a video for the **TDS Multimedia Team** , so you might see me and Dave on the silver screen in the near future. There were also some games going on, but my eye was on the burger-prize!

Nice to have some fun and socializing within a work context. We should do such things every week, not just once per year 🙂
