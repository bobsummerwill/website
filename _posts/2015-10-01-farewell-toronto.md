My time in Toronto is coming to an end next week.

It has been a blast, but my Vancouver family and home is calling.

My contract at TD Securities expires next Friday. I would like to continue to work for TD, but the messy reality sees me as a "free agent" within a very few days. I hope to return to TD for a second spell (but working remotely from Vancouver most of the time), but the wheels turn slowly within large organizations, and that may or may not ever come to fruition.

_I am job hunting for Vancouver-based or remote-friendly roles._

**Next Tuesday evening (6th October), please mark your calendar. I will line up some kind of evite for a booze-up open for anybody who would like to come and share a drink with me "until we meet again".**
