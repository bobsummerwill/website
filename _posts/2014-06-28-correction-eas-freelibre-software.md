In my previous posting [Did you know about EA’s Open Source software?](<https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/2014/06/25/ea-open-source-software/>), I referred to the software as [Open Source](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>), where it is actually more specifically [Free/Libre](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>) software, under the [GPL (General Public License)](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GPL>) or [LGPL (Lesser General Public License)](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License>)

That is actually a significant distinction in this particular case, because it is the [Copyleft](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft>) protections in the [LGPL](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License>) license which compelled the release of this software by EA. Their use of [Webkit](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit>) forced the release of a subset of EA's internal technology, which had to be statically linked against their fork of [Webkit](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit>).

So please excuse my earlier slack language, FLOSS-ers!
