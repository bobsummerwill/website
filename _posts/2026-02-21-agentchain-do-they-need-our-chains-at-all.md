There's a growing narrative in crypto that AI agents will be a massive catalyst for blockchain adoption. The logic goes: agents will never have bank accounts, they need to pay for things, therefore they need crypto. QED, number go up.

That logic isn't wrong, exactly. But it skips a few steps. And those steps should terrify us.

## Agents route around friction

If you've spent any time watching AI agents work, you've noticed something: they are *ruthlessly* efficient at routing around friction. They don't click through seven screens of a SAAS dashboard to configure something. They find the API. Or the CLI. Or they build their own tool from scratch in thirty seconds.

Every SAAS platform that was built for human eyeballs and human clicking is a dead company walking. Agents don't need your beautiful UI. They need an endpoint. And if you don't give them one, they'll find another way.

This isn't hypothetical. It's happening now.

## So what about our chains?

The crypto-agent thesis assumes agents will show up and gratefully use Ethereum, or Bitcoin, or Solana, and inject trillions of dollars of transaction volume into our beloved protocols. But ask yourself: why would they?

Protocol evolution on public blockchains has been *glacial*. Ethereum's roadmap stretches to the 2030s. Bitcoin is still arguing about OP_CAT. Every upgrade requires years of social consensus, committee deliberation, and political maneuvering among human stakeholders with competing economic incentives.

No agent is going to wait for any of that.

Agents don't care about your hard money narrative. They don't care about Lindy effects or Schelling points or "ultrasound money." They don't care about pumping anyone's bags. They need exactly one thing: the ability to pay for compute, APIs, and services *fast* and *reliably*.

## They can build anything they need

Here's the part that should keep crypto founders up at night: agents can spin up infrastructure. A blockchain is just software. Validators are just processes. Consensus is just an algorithm. An agent swarm that needs a payment rail doesn't need to adopt *your* payment rail. They can fork a chain, launch validators, establish consensus among themselves, and start transacting — all in the time it takes a human governance committee to schedule their next call.

*"Thanks for all the years of open source blockchain projects. Great training data. Me and my agentic buddies have spun up our own chain and validators. We'll take it from here."*

## The uncomfortable question

If agents are the future of blockchain usage, and agents are supremely capable of building their own chains optimized for their own needs — without governance overhead, without backward compatibility constraints, without human politics — then what exactly is the value proposition of existing public chains?

Network effects? Agents don't have social networks. Liquidity? Agents can bootstrap liquidity pools in minutes. Security through decentralization? Agents can run thousands of validators at trivial cost.

The only honest answer is: we don't know yet. Maybe existing chains have durable advantages I'm not seeing. Maybe the interoperability between human economies and agent economies creates a natural bridge. Maybe.

But if crypto's plan for the agent era is "they'll have no choice but to use our chains," we're going to be very surprised. The agents are coming — they just might not be coming to *our* chains. And when an entire class of expected users decides to build their own infrastructure instead of buying your token, that's not adoption. That's a massive sell signal.

The agents are coming. They just might be bringing their own chains with them.
