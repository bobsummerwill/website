There's a growing narrative in crypto that AI agents will be a massive catalyst for blockchain adoption. Agents will never have bank accounts, they need to pay for things, therefore they need crypto. QED, number go up.

That logic isn't wrong, exactly. But it skips a few steps. And those steps should terrify us.

## Agents route around friction

AI agents are *ruthlessly* efficient at routing around friction. They don't click through your SAAS dashboard — they find the API, the CLI, or they build their own tool in thirty seconds. Every platform built for human eyeballs is a dead company walking.

So what makes us think they'll patiently use our chains?

## They can build their own

Protocol evolution on public blockchains has been *glacial*. Ethereum's roadmap stretches to the 2030s. Bitcoin is still arguing about OP_CAT. Every upgrade requires years of social consensus and political maneuvering among humans with competing incentives.

No agent is going to wait for any of that. A blockchain is just software. Consensus is just an algorithm. An agent swarm that needs a payment rail can fork a chain, launch validators, and start transacting — all in the time it takes a governance committee to schedule their next call.

Network effects? Agents don't have social networks. Liquidity? They can bootstrap pools in minutes. Decentralization? They can run thousands of validators at trivial cost.

## The uncomfortable question

If crypto's plan for the agent era is "they'll have no choice but to use our chains," we're going to be very surprised. When an entire class of expected users decides to build their own infrastructure instead of buying your token, that's not adoption — that's a sell signal.

The agents are coming. They just might be bringing their own chains with them.
