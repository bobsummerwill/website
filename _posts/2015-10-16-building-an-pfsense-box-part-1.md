So … I've been doing my first hardware build for a very, very long time. Back in the 90s I remember buying extra memory, video cards, etc, but this is my first ever full machine build.

I'm setting up a [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) box for my home network, on Stephane Matis' recommendation (thanks, Stephane!)

So where am I up to? Put all the hardware together, and successfully booting. Now I find that I don't actually have a physical keyboard in this house 🙂 Off to get a cheap keyboard and then to move onto the software install. I also need to work out where this box is going to be located physically in the house. The cable comes into the house downstairs by the TV, but that is a child-ridden danger area. I might need to run some Ethernet cable up-and-away to a safer place!
