There is a pattern which has run through my whole life. I try **everything**.

I am a [ENTP](https://www.truity.com/personality-type/ENTP) according to the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/) with the "P" standing for Prospector.

Some website call this type of person "The Debater", some call it "The Diplomat", some call it "The Visionary". The specific labels are not as important as the [characterization of the patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) of behaviour. Those are **spot on** in describing me.

I was a lot more introverted earlier in my life, so was an INTP. I have also had long spells of severe depression, and more recently hypomanic phases. I finally got what I believe is a correct diagnosis on 30th Oct 2019 - [Cyclothymia](https://twitter.com/BobSummerwill/status/1189680077178433537). Or, as my good friend, [Texture](https://twitter.com/iamtexture), calls it ["Baby bipolar"](https://twitter.com/iamtexture/status/1189782388152209408) 😂

From [Judging ("J") or Perceiving ("P")](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/judging-or-perceiving.htm) article on [myersbriggs.org:](https://myersbriggs.org)

_The following statements generally apply to me:_

- _I like to stay open to respond to whatever happens._
    * _I appear to be loose and casual. I like to keep plans to a minimum._
    * _I like to approach work as play or mix work and play._
    * _I work in bursts of energy._
    * _I am stimulated by an approaching deadline._
    * _Sometimes I stay open to new information so long I miss making decisions when they are needed._



When I say everything, I mean **everything** :

  * I got fooled into joining [Amway](https://www.amway.com/) when I was 18-19. I think that experience really helped me to [understand the danger in OneCoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4wp0br/ethereum_dev_onecoin_is_a_pure_scam/?st=k3fyr8r9&sh=3eadbe17).

  * I was a gold bug, a sovereign citizen, a prepper and a huge Alex Jones fan in 2009. I stocked up on decades worth of dry food, baseball bats (no guns for me), old US silver coins for barter, the lot. I learned to grow my own vegetables. I was learning to sail (so I could get a boat as my "escape route" from collapsing Vancouver when SHTF. I was looking at buying property in Chile. I was totally bought on New World Order, Bilderberg, Council for Foreign Relations, Bohemian Grove, etc. I used Liberty Reserve. I was looking at buying additional citizenships, some through very shady means. I was a 9/11 Truther. I even went down the Birther rabbit hole for a while and started doubting vaccines 🙂
  * I was a Libertarian and Ron Paul fan. I followed the 2012 US Presidential Election intensely. Was gutted at how he was treated. I still think that his position on Military spending is spot on. Abolishing pretty much all government functions and social welfare nets? Maybe not so wise, I see now.
  * For years I was obsessed with trying to understand how on earth Germany descended into Nazi hell. I have shelves and shelves of books on Nazi Germany and WWII. I have a copy of Mein Kampf. I also have shelves of books on the USSR and Communism, and multiple books on Stalin and Lenin and Mao.
  * I was fascinated with the Occupy movement when that came around.



In a more mundate form, I has seen this behaviour in myself in a work context too.

I was at Electronic Arts for 15+ years, and in that time I found myself on nearly every different side of every fence there was within that organization. Working on game teams, in central technology teams, on workwide initiatives. As an individual developer, as a technical lead, in an architectural oversite role. Visit "every bucket".

Same in my Ethereum journey. I started as a community member. Then I was a volunteer. Then I was "on the inside", working for the Ethereum Foundation. Then I was at ConsenSys, working for the largest for-profit entity within the space. There I was deeply involved in the creation, launch and operation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and involved with Hyperledger. So very different dynamic within a consortium of frenemies. Then I was at Sweetbridge and Quantfury, and setting up Varro Technologies with Alison - trying to work through startup land - and building your own company. Then I flipped over to Ethereum Classic, which was seen by some as "the mortal enemy". Not me!

What does all of this mean?

I have probably "been you" at some point, because I try everything out. I may or may not "like those clothes" for a long time, but I will at least try and am thoroughly curious and seek to understand EVERYONE and EVERYTHING. I like to think that I have a lot of empathy and compassion because of my breadth of human interactions. I hate unresolved conflict.

It is exceedingly unlikely that I am "your enemy", and if you see me say things which "trigger" you, or which sound like my thinking is hostile to you and your beliefs, the likelihood is that that is untrue. I have skin as thick an elephant, so please just tell me whatever your issue with my statements is, and we will have a conversation like adults.

**Criticism is welcome. I am a big boy. Let me have it! In public or privately as you wish. We might both learn something in the process.**

**I have been called an Infinite Fucking Looper, a Corporate Communist, a Socialist, a Misogynist, a Racist, an Egotist, a Tyrant, an Authoritarian, an Ethereum Maximalist, an ETC Maximalist, a Hyperledger Maximalist.**

**There is nothing you can say which I have not heard before. I think all of these labels are totally miss the mark, but I take no offense. Just words.**

The only Maximalism which I would confess to would be Humanity Maximalism. I believe that most humans are essentially good, and that collaboration is the path to our Star Trek future.

Even that I would temper, though. I love [cats ](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/06/12/cats-and-dogs-can-be-friends/)[**and**](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/06/12/cats-and-dogs-can-be-friends/)[ dogs](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/06/12/cats-and-dogs-can-be-friends/) and other animals too, and I hope that I get to meet aliens one day as well.
