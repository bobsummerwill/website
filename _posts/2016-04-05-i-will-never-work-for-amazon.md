Today I have been contacted **yet again** by a recruiter from Amazon:

![amazon_logo_500500-_v323939215_](/assets/images/2016/04/amazon_logo_500500-_v323939215_.png)

This is despite my LinkedIn summary **starting** with the following text:

> **(Please don 't contact me about Amazon roles. **Also ONLY opportunities in Vancouver or remote-friendly please**)**

This is despite me having already said **NO!** to Amazon recruiters on numerous occasions in the past few years and explicitly asking to be blacklisted. They obviously don't share any information between themselves.

This is all despite me publicly [boycotting Amazon since 2014](http://bobsummerwill.com/2014/05/31/why-i-am-boycotting-amazon/).

Amazon is a horrible, horrible, company. Please, Amazon recruiters, never darken my door again. Seriously. Thank you.

For any recruiters seeking to understand **what I have to offer** and **what my requirements** are, I wrote this [Bob Summerwill for Recruiters ](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bob-summerwill-recruiters-bob-summerwill)article. I am not looking for new opportunities at the moment, but that's what I'm looking for if I become available again in the future.

And everybody, please read the New York Times article from last year: **[Inside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all)**
