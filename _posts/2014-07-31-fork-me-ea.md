I wrote a [blog post in June 2014](<https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/2014/06/25/ea-open-source-software/>) talking about EA's silent technology releases to <http://gpl.ea.com>, and what a shame it was that these releases were not publicized and celebrated, and made into a more usable form.

Kitsilano Software have now made usable github repos for each of these packages.

See [Fork me, EA!](<http://kitsilanosoftware.wordpress.com/2014/07/31/fork-me-ea/>) article at <http://kitsilanosoftware.com> for more details.
