On 12th April 2018 I made a long awaited return to Electronic Arts Vancouver (formerly called EAC - EA Canada), my employer from 1999-2014. I worked at this particular office in Burnaby for 11 years.

[**Here are my slides**](<https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blockchain-ea.pdf> "Blockchain @ EA")

I was back for the first time in four years to do a presentation and AMA on potential applications for blockchain in the games industry and for EA specifically. It was so much fun. I spent over five hours there in total, with the presentation and AMA running well over time because we were enjoying it so much, and then some people hanging around even after that.

My thanks go out to [David Bowen](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-j-o-bowen/>), a blockchain enthusiast who I have been talking to since last summer when he first reached out to me and we met for coffee and blockchain chat in Kitsilano. He made all the arrangements for this session, and I am truly grateful to him for the opportunity to come back.

For anybody who was there, **please do stay in touch**!

I am a sociable kind of fellow, and would love to keep the conversation going, on [Linked](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsummerwill/>), on [Twitter](<https://twitter.com/BobSummerwill>), via email - **bob@summerwill.net** , or through any of my other [means of contact](<http://bobsummerwill.com/contact/>).

Or check out the projects I am associated with at [Ethereum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum>), [Sweetbridge](<https://sweetbridge.com/>) and [Varro Technologies](<https://twitter.com/VarroTech>).
