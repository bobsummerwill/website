This is a public statement by Bob Summerwill, last updated 29th February 2020, giving a full enumeration of his associations and financial arrangements.

Bob first announced the creation of this statement [on Twitter on 29th November 2017:](https://twitter.com/BobSummerwill/status/935924023287934977)

_“ I have made a Conflict of Interests Statement on my website and will keep it updated in perpetuity. We are not playing games. We are now talking to heads of state, central bankers, Fortune 500 CEOs, etc. Ethics and transparency are critical.”_

This statement is made in the spirit of full disclosure, to avoid any possible future accusation of conflict of interests or unethical financial conduct.

TODO – Version-control this document in git, and then anchor the hash on ETC mainnet periodically.
