If is best to start with email to **bob@summerwill.net**.

If you are following up about some prior contact (meeting at a conference, talking on Telegram, exchanging tweets, etc) please refer to that context in your email so that I remember who you are.

When we have established a connection, this is my preference order for communications software:

     1. [Signal](<https://signal.org/>) - **bobsummerwill.01** - E2EE text, voice or video
     2. email - **bob@summerwill.net** (no PGP)
     3. [Telegram](<https://telegram.org>) (**bobsummerwill**) - public groups, regular and secret chats
     4. [Twitter](<https://twitter.com>) (**[@bobsummerwill](<https://twitter.com/BobSummerwill> "@BobSummerwill")**) - public tweets (_I do not read DMs from people I do not follow_)
     5. [LinkedIn](<https://linkedin.com>) (**[Bob Summerwill](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsummerwill> "Bob Summerwill")**) - public networking and private DMs.
     6. Cell phone (text or voice)

With Signal being by far my preferred channel for all communication, given its strong end-to-end-encryption for text, attachments, audio and video formats.
