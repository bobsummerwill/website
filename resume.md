Bob has been working at the heart of the Ethereum ecosystem since mid 2015. His work on Ethereum started independently – adding ARM Linux cross-builds for the cpp-ethereum client to bring Ethereum to mobile and wearable Linux. That community involvement led to a full-time role at the Ethereum Foundation and then a move to ConsenSys and a pivotal role in the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. He served as Vice-Chair on the EEA Technical Steering Committee. Bob has also been engaged with Hyperledger since 2016 and stood for election to the Hyperledger TSC in August 2018.

Bob previously worked at [TD Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Securities) in 2015, leading their DevOps, tooling and OpenStack cloud migration initiatives worldwide as a key member of a new Agile Transformation team. While there he organized the first ever [DevOps for Banks](https://bobsummerwill.wordpress.com/2015/09/21/devopsto-meetup-devops-for-banks-special-session/) Meetup in Toronto.
