Any help with the accuracy of this public record much appreciated. I will Github it sometime.

This is an attempt by [Bob Summerwill](<https://bobsummerwill.com/about>) (along with [Ethereum Foundation People](<http://bobsummerwill.com/ethereum-foundation-people/>)) at building up some canonical history of the Ethereum Project and the Ethereum Foundation
