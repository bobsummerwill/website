**Overview**

As Head of Ecosystem at [BlockApps](<https://blockapps.net>), Bob is helping to drive the transition of STRATO Mercata from a closed-source platform to a rich, decentralized ecosystem, bridging on-chain and real world assets.

Bob Summerwill was previously Executive Director for the [ETC Cooperative](<https://etccooperative.org/>) and has been working full-time on blockchain projects since late 2015. He worked on [Ethereum](<https://ethereum.org>) and [Hyperledger](<https://hyperledger.org>) in earlier years, followed by a switch to [Ethereum Classic](<https://ethereumclassic.org>) and a belated [Bitcoin](<https://bitcoin.org>) orange-pilling. He has a growing interest in privacy projects.

Bob has been programming since 1984 and as a professional software engineer since 1996 (primarily working on [AAA video games](<https://bobsummerwill.com/bobliography/>)). Originally from the UK, he has lived in Vancouver since 2003, and is now a dual citizen of Canada and the UK.

**Biography**

Bob was foundational in the creation of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance,](<http://entethalliance.org>) working full-time on that project for [ConsenSys](<http://consensys.net>) from October 2016 to October 2017. He co-presented the [Technical Roadmap](<https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1137845>) (5:05) at the EEA launch event and served first as [Secretary of the Technical Working Group](<https://bobsummerwill.com/2017/06/27/whats-been-happening-in-the-eea/>) and subsequently as [Vice-Chair of the Technical Steering Committee](<https://entethalliance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TSC/blog/2017/07/12/14090259/Rebooting+the+Technical+Steering+Committee>).

That role followed a spell at the [Ethereum Foundation](<https://ethereum.org/foundation>), where he was a developer on the [cpp-ethereum](<http://cpp-ethereum.org>) client, leading a major refactoring and revamp of the codebase ([cpp-ethereum-1.3.0 "Homecoming"](<https://github.com/bobsummerwill/cpp-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.3.0>)) and led a [failed](<https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5qp5pc/ethcore_blocked_cppethereum_permissive_relicensing/?st=j8uq42ns&sh=9b57abb6>) effort at [re-licensing cpp-ethereum](<https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/ethereum-everywhere/>) which was intended to open up the possibility of an Ethereum client within [Hyperledger](<http://hyperledger.org>) seven months before [Monax contributed Burrow](<https://monax.io/blog/2017/02/28/why-were-joining-hyperledger/>) and three years before [PegaSys contributed Besu](<https://www.hyperledger.org/announcements/2019/09/11/consensys-joins-hyperledger-as-a-premier-member>). If the earlier attempt had succeed then the work of the EEA would likely have occurred within Hyperledger, with Ethereum and Hyperledger communities bridged by mid 2016.

Bob previously worked as a DevOps Solution Architect for [TD Securities](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Securities> "TD Securities") in Toronto for 6 months in 2015, as well as starting work on [cpp-ethereum-cross](<https://github.com/doublethinkco/cpp-ethereum-cross/>) through his [doublethinkco](<http://doublethink.co>) company. Toronto is where his [Ethereum journey](<https://bobsummerwill.com/2017/10/18/bobs-next-adventure/>) really got serious.

Prior to that, Bob had an 18 years career in video games, starting at [Sony Psygnosis](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis> "Sony Psygnosis") in 1996 and then moving on to AAA titles at [Electronic Arts](<http://ea.com> "Electronic Arts") for 15+ years (FIFA, NHL, NBA, UFC and [more](<http://bobsummerwill.com/games/>)), mainly for PlayStation and XBOX. Bob served in many different technical leadership roles at EA, culminating to his appointment as the first ever EA Sports Label Software Architect and Chair of the Architecture Council, EA Sports in 2012.

After EA, Bob worked for short time on [Unity3D](<http://unity3d.com> "Unity3D") mobile titles at [Roadhouse Interactive](<http://roadhouseinteractive.com> "Roadhouse Interactive") and [DeNA](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis> "DeNA"), followed by a short period of consultancy at the [Sony SCE San Diego](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment>) studio.

During this period, Bob was also doing Tizen development, building [MonoTizen](<https://kitsilanosoftware.github.io/MonoTizen/>), writing for [Tizen Experts](<https://www.iotgadgets.com/author/bob-summerwill/>) and contracting on Tizen [smartwatch development](<https://www.iotgadgets.com/2015/12/how-to-deploy-to-gear-s2-smartwatch/>), as well as starting on Mono for Sailfish. Tizen was [not](<https://kitsilanosoftware.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/the-tizen-project-is-broken-we-will-be-spending-some-time-apart-3/>) a happy [experience](<https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/22/tizen-the-emperor-has-no-clothes/>), but he learnt a lot and made some good friends in both the Tizen and Sailfish communities.
